# Assessment helper

This little script will create a handy test HTML file automatically associated with whatever .js files are in the directory you call it from.

This is still in Beta. Try it out BEFORE an assessment, not during :)

## Installation
1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. In the local repository:
```
chmod +x runner
```
3. In your bash profile:
```
alias asshelper='<path to runner file>' # â€” make it possible to run assistant helper from any directory
```

## Usage
1. Clone the assessment
2. In the local assessment repo, run command (or whatever alias you chose):
```
asshelper
```
This will generate the file with <script> tags set appropriately and open the file. It only checks the PWD, so make sure you call it from the correct folder.

## Uninstallation
1. Just delete the repo and any alias you created
2. If you want to be really thorough, also delete the runner.html file from your assessment directory
